# *TagTrace*

***TagTrace* is a tool for creative management of your image collection with help of tags (*topical association grammas*).**

Watching digital images, we are usually tied to the structure of the folders they contain them. *TagTrace* helps you to compile your own image collection online, tag the images and then click through them, being independent from rigid folder structures.  Your tags you can follow like traces leading through your image collection. Each image thus becomes a topical node point, watching them one after another becomes like strolling through a rhizome-like mesh of associative cross references.

I developed *TagTrace* as capstone project during my web development bootcamp at *neue fische* in Cologne.


### To get it running:

* Clone or fork the project
* Run ```npm i``` 
* In order to run the databases, you need an account each for MongoDB and Cloudinary. Deposit your keys in a .env file
* ```npm run dev``` starts the server
