# _TagTrace_

**_TagTrace_ is a tool for creative management of your image collection with help of tags (_topical association grammas_).**

Watching digital images, we are usually tied to the structure of the folders they contain them. _TagTrace_ helps you to compile your own image collection online, tag the images and then click through them, being independent from rigid folder structures.  
You can follow your tags like traces leading through your image collection. Each image thus becomes a topical node point, looking at them one after another becomes like strolling through a rhizome-like mesh of associative cross references.

I developed _TagTrace_ as capstone project during my web development bootcamp at _neue fische_ in Cologne.

### To get it running:

- Clone or fork the project
- Run `npm i`
- In order to run the databases, you need an account each for MongoDB and Cloudinary. Deposit your keys in a .env file
- `npm run dev` starts the server
